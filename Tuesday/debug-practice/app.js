console.log("hello,world");
const myVariable = "yada, yada, yada";
debugger;

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
//in inspect sources I added a conditional event breakpoint where code would stop at if i < 50. the debugger code here also stopped code from running until I skipped over it.
